# 📊 Real-Time Twitter Analytics Dashboard using Power BI

This project is part of my internship work where I analyzed Twitter data using **Power BI** to build a real-time analytics dashboard. The goal was to uncover patterns in tweet engagement and display dynamic visualizations based on time, content, and media performance.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Tweet Dataset (CSV Format)
- Data Filtering & Conditional Visualization Logic

## 💡 Key Features
- **Scatter Plot** for media views vs media engagement, filtered by tweets with more than 10 replies.
- **Time-Based Visibility:** Charts only appear between 6 PM to 11 PM IST using DAX.
- **Dynamic Filters:** Based on engagement rate (>5%), keyword length, and word count.
- **Conditional Chart Display** using DAX to hide irrelevant visuals.
- **Interactive Slicers** for flexible exploration.

## 📌 Use Case
Ideal for marketers and data analysts to understand the impact of content strategy and optimal posting times based on live social media metrics.

## 📁 Files
